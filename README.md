Document Similarity Analysis using AI
Project Overview
This project provides a tool for analyzing the similarity between documents using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. It is designed to help users compare legal documents, research papers, or other forms of textual data to identify overlapping content and assess their degree of similarity.

Features
NLP Preprocessing: Cleans and processes documents to prepare them for analysis.
Multiple Similarity Algorithms: Includes methods like cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and more advanced techniques.
Customizable: Users can adjust thresholds and algorithms to meet specific needs.
Scalable: Suitable for large datasets.
Real-world Applications: Useful in legal document analysis, academic plagiarism detection, content comparison, etc.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras (for any deep learning models)
Scikit-learn (for feature extraction and similarity algorithms)
NLTK or SpaCy (for text preprocessing)
Flask or Django (optional, for web-based application)
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.11.5 or higher
Pip package manager
